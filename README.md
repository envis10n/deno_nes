# deno_nes

An NES emulator written in TypeScript for the Deno runtime.

This is being written as I follow along with [this ebook](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook).

As the original material was written for Rust, I am converting things to TypeScript as I encounter problems (such as the lack of multiple numeric types).

Tests are located in `cpu.test.ts`.
